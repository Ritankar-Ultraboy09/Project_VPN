OPEN 4 terminals on UBUNTU and dedicate each one for the under mentioned:-
1. AES.h
2. Server.c
3.clientmain.c
4 PacketCapture.c 

1. Run the AES.h first , since it is the header file as it provides Advanced Encryption Standard for the encrypting and decrypting of the client and server.

run the code:- `` gcc -o aes_encryption aes_test.c AES.c -lssl -lcrypto `` to compile
and run:- 
./aes_encryption

2. Execute the Packet Capture file and run 
``gcc -o packet_capture PacketCapture.c -lpcap`` to compile and 
sudo ./packet_capture to execute. 
it will send the 
3. Run the server -
code to compile- ``gcc -o server server.c AES.c -lssl -lcrypto``
run - ``sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev lo``  assign the IP 10.0.0.1 to a virtual network interface
``./server``

4. Run the client
``-gcc -o client clientmain.c AES.c -lssl -lcrypto`` to compile
`sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev lo` -  assign the IP 10.0.0.2 to its virtual network interface

./client

5. Open another Ubuntu terminal and run 
sudo tcpdump -i lo host 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.2 -w vpn_capture.pcap

for capturing the flow between the server and client

this demonstrates a simple VPN working.
